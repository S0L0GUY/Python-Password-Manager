# Python-Password-Manager
This is a simple password manager created by Evan Grinnell. It encrypts passwords using AES encryption and allows for decryption with a user-provided key.

# Installation

Before running the project, ensure you have `pycryptodome` installed. You can install it using pip:
pip install pycryptodome

# Functionality

## Encryption and Decryption

The password manager encrypts passwords using AES encryption and stores them in encrypted_passwords.json. Decryption requires the decryption key that you set during usage.

## Password Management

You can add new passwords, view a list of all stored passwords (after decryption), and quit while saving changes.
